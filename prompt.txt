**Task:**  
Categorize the following message into one of three categories: **normal**, **freaky**, or **insult**. Use the provided examples to guide your classification. If a message fits both **freaky** and **insult**, categorize it as **freaky**. **freaky** is explicitly designed to indicate something sexual, so something like "Bro say that one more time and imma eat you" would just be considered normal.

**Examples:**

- **Freaky:**
  - im so down pookie bear
  - my friend just told me he got touched by the final
  - che102 final touched me
  - Bro molests me ð­ð­
  - rizz??

- **Insult:**
  - Fuck u
  - You suck
  - Yeah bro u kinda suck

- **Normal:**
  - Ask em out
  - cuz u hadnt met me yet
  - bros tryna imply sum
  - Nicole goated at badminton
  - Bro say that one more time and imma eat you

**Instructions:**

1. **Read the message carefully.**
2. **Determine which category the message best fits based on the examples.**
3. **If the message fits both **freaky** and **insult**, choose **freaky**.**
4. **Respond with only the category name: `normal`, `freaky`, or `insult`. Do not include any additional text or explanation.**
